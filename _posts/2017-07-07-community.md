I noticed that r/seattle was a toxic af community, so we decided to be the change we wanted to see in the world.

We succeeded.

We didn't need to do much.  Just let people post things on the biggest community website to their neighbors.

Discord gave us a partner instance at [discord.gg/seattle](https://discord.gg/seattle)

It's been cool and it looks like people are starting to get this whole try to talk decently to each other and post cool stuff thing.  Remember that before everyone started getting all important and curating?

That's it.
